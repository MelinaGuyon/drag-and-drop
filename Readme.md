Drag and drop prototype // Released during my internship in AKQA

This is the prototype of a user experience manage by AKQA. Users can drag and drop words and sort them in a way to create funny sentences. When they have finish they can save their work and download it as an image or they can choose to play again.

I worked on it nine days in the AKQA office.
